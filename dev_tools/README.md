# Curses Tools

This folder contains a couple of small helper scripts used while developing the main UI:

- `pycurses.py` — Minimalist demo by [Clay McLeod](https://gist.github.com/claymcleod/b670285f334acd56ad1c#file-pycurses-py), useful for checking the unicode value of typed keys.

- `color_finder.py` — Lets you scroll through ncurses' available colors using arrow keys.
